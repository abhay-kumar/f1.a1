# Create RSS.com Podcast Upload Content

Generate all the content needed to manually upload a podcast episode to RSS.com.

## Input

**Project name** (required): $ARGUMENTS

The project name is the folder name under `projects/` containing the podcast to upload.

## Instructions

1. **Validate the project exists** and has required files:
   - Check `projects/{project}/output/final.mp3` exists
   - Check `projects/{project}/script.json` exists

2. **Generate cover art** if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   python3 src/podcast_cover_generator.py --project {project} --episode {episode_num} --title "{short_title}"
   ```

3. **Read the script.json** and extract:
   - Title
   - Host information
   - All segments with text, context, and emotion

4. **Generate the RSS.com upload content** in this format:

---

### Episode Details

**Title:** `{title}` (clean, without "F1 Burnouts:" prefix if present)

**Season Number:** `1`

**Episode Number:** `{extract from title or ask user}`

**Episode Type:** `Full`

---

### Description

Generate a description with:
- Opening hook (first 1-2 sentences from segment 1)
- "Topics covered:" section (list relevant segment contexts, skip generic ones like "intro", "outro", "closing")
- "Timestamps:" section (calculate from word count, ~150 words/minute)
- Footer with podcast tagline and hashtags

Format:
```
{Opening text from first segment, ~300 chars}

Topics covered:
- {topic 1}
- {topic 2}
...

Timestamps:
00:00 - {context 1}
00:22 - {context 2}
...

### Keywords

Generate relevant keywords based on script content:
- Always include: F1, Formula 1, Podcast, Motorsport, Racing, F1 Burnouts
- Add topic-specific keywords detected from script (e.g., Sustainable Fuel, E-fuels, 2026)
- Add team names mentioned (Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, etc.)
- Add driver names mentioned (Verstappen, Hamilton, Alonso, etc.)
- Add technical terms (Carbon Capture, Fischer-Tropsch, etc.)

List each keyword on a separate line for easy copy-paste.

### Files to Upload

Provide absolute paths:
```
Audio file:
/Users/abhaykumar/Documents/f1.ai/projects/{project}/output/final.mp3

Cover art:
/Users/abhaykumar/Documents/f1.ai/projects/{project}/output/cover_art.jpg
```

---

## Timestamp Calculation

Calculate timestamps based on word count:
- Speech rate: ~150 words per minute (2.5 words/second)
- For each segment, calculate duration: `word_count / 2.5`
- Accumulate time for each subsequent segment
- Format as `MM:SS`

## Example Output

For a project called `sustainable-fuels-podcast`:

```

## Notes

- RSS.com requires video/audio files, MP3 is accepted directly
- Cover art should be square (the generator creates 3000x3000)
- Cover art uses the official F1 font (Formula1-Bold) for episode number and title
- Episode number and title are displayed in large, bold text for visibility
- Keep keywords to ~15-20 max for best results
- Description can be long - RSS.com supports detailed show notes
